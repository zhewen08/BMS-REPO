\section{Related Work}
\begin{itemize}
\item
Main point to make: the work is significantly different from all the existing solutions!
Not necessarily better
It is not incremental, which extends the existing ones a little bit
\item
Novelty of the problem: one of the following
formulated a NEW problem in this paper!
identified NEW issues to an existing problem
\item
Novelty of the solution
The idea explored in this paper is completely different from all others in the literature
used new techniques borrowed from other areas or fields
No one has done so, I’m the first one
\item
Novelty of the evaluation
used new analysis/experimental methods that no one has used before
Stay at the level as high as possible: the contribution is major, not minor improvements (no need to comment on the detailed level)
Do not discuss the novelty of each component of the solution, only the main idea of the solution
Component novelty is described in the design section already, not here
